## How to Use the Mental Omega Map Editor
  
The Mental Omega map editor is based on FinalAlert 2, a popular map editor for Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge. To use it, you need to follow these steps:
  
1. Download the latest version of Mental Omega from [here](http://mentalomega.com/index.php?page=download).
2. Extract the files to your Red Alert 2 directory.
3. Copy the following files from your Red Alert 2 directory to a new folder: `FinalAlert2.exe`, `FinalAlert2.ini`, `FinalAlert2.map`, `FinalAlert2.mix`, `FinalAlert2.yrm`, `ra2.csf`, `ra2md.csf`.
4. Rename `FinalAlert2.exe` to `MentalOmega.exe`.
5. Create a shortcut for `MentalOmega.exe` on your desktop or start menu.
6. Right-click on the shortcut and select Properties.
7. In the Target field, add `-CD mentalomega -UI finalalert2.ini -LOGO finalalert2.mix -MOD finalalert2.map -YR finalalert2.yrm -CSF ra2.csf -CSFMD ra2md.csf` after the file path. For example: `"C:\Games\Red Alert 2\MentalOmega\MentalOmega.exe" -CD mentalomega -UI finalalert2.ini -LOGO finalalert2.mix -MOD finalalert2.map -YR finalalert2.yrm -CSF ra2.csf -CSFMD ra2md.csf`.
8. Click OK to save the changes.
9. Run the shortcut as administrator.
10. You should see the Mental Omega logo and then the map editor interface.
11. Select New Map from the File menu or press Ctrl+N.
12. Select a map size, theater (terrain type) and game mode (standard or survival).
13. Click OK to create a blank map.
14. You can now use the tools on the left panel to place terrain, buildings, units, triggers, waypoints and other elements on your map.
15. You can also use the menus on the top bar to access more options and settings.
16. To test your map, save it as a \*.map file in the Maps/Custom subdirectory of your Red Alert 2 directory. Then run Mental Omega normally and select your map from the bottom of the map selection screen in skirmish or multiplayer mode.
