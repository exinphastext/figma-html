However, using the cheat engine also comes with some risks and drawbacks. Some of them are:

- The cheat engine may not work with every version or patch of Ostriv. You may need to update or download a new cheat table file for it to work properly.
- The cheat engine may cause some bugs or glitches in the game. For example, some users have reported that using the Add Resources cheat can cause their livestock to multiply uncontrollably and die, resulting in lag and save corruption.
- The cheat engine may ruin your enjoyment or challenge of the game. Using cheats can make the game too easy or boring, and take away from the satisfaction of building your town from scratch.

Therefore, you should use the cheat engine at your own discretion and responsibility. If you decide to use it, make sure to back up your save files before doing so, and disable any cheats that you don't need or want. Also, remember that Ostriv is still in development and may change or improve over time, so you may not need to use cheats at all in the future.
