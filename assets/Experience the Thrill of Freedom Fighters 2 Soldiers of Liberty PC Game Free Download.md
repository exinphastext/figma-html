# Freedom Fighters 2: Soldiers of Liberty - A Sequel That Never Was
 
Freedom Fighters 2: Soldiers of Liberty was a planned sequel to the 2003 third-person shooter game Freedom Fighters, developed by IO Interactive and published by Electronic Arts. The game was set in an alternate history where the Soviet Union had invaded and occupied New York City, and the player controlled Christopher Stone, a plumber turned resistance leader. The game was supposed to feature more freedom of choice, a deeper story, and improved graphics and gameplay.
 
However, Freedom Fighters 2 never saw the light of day. The game was canceled by IO Interactive, who moved on to work on other projects, such as Hitman and Kane & Lynch. The reasons for the cancellation are unclear, but some speculate that it was due to poor sales of the first game, lack of interest from EA, or creative differences between the developers and the publishers. Some fans still hope that IO Interactive will revive the franchise someday, as they still own the rights to it.

Freedom Fighters 2: Soldiers of Liberty remains a lost gem in the history of video games. It had the potential to be a great sequel to a cult classic, but it was never given a chance to shine. If you want to experience the original Freedom Fighters game, you can still find it on various platforms, such as PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. You can also download it for free from some websites, but be careful of viruses and malware.
  
Freedom Fighters 2: Soldiers of Liberty was also supposed to have some new and improved gameplay features, according to some sources. Some of these features were:
 
- Squad-based gameplay: The player could recruit and lead up to 12 freedom fighters into battle, giving them orders and commands with a simple button press. The player's charisma and leadership skills would affect the number and loyalty of the recruits.
- Urban guerrilla warfare: The player could engage in various missions and objectives in the streets, subways, and buildings of New York City, using stealth, sabotage, or brute force. The player could also use various weapons and items, such as machine guns, rocket launchers, Molotov cocktails, and martial arts.
- Transforming environments: The game would feature dynamic weather and seasons, as well as destructible environments that would change the gameplay and tactics. The game would also have a day-night cycle that would affect the visibility and enemy behavior.
- Multiplayer support: The game would support up to four players in a split-screen mode on the console versions, allowing them to cooperate or compete in various modes and maps.

Freedom Fighters 2: Soldiers of Liberty was a promising sequel that could have expanded and improved on the original game's concept and mechanics. Unfortunately, it was never released to the public, and remains a mystery to this day. Perhaps one day, IO Interactive will revisit this franchise and give it the sequel it deserves.
