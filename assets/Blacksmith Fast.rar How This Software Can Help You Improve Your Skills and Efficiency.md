How to Reset Your Item Level
 
Once you have upgraded your item to +10 and added 5 gems to it, you can reset its level back to +0 and start over. This will keep the stats from the gems and allow you to add more. To do this, you need a special item called a Reset Stone. You can get Reset Stones from various sources, such as quests, events, bosses, or other players. You can also buy them from the Item Mall for real money.
 
To use a Reset Stone, go to the NPC blacksmith and open the upgrade menu. Select your +10 item and drag the Reset Stone to the slot below it. Click on "Reset" and confirm. Your item will now be +0 again and ready for another round of upgrading.

How to Craft Your Own Weapons
 
If you want to craft your own weapons instead of using the ones you find or buy, you need to learn some weapon crafting skills. You can do this by finding weapon crafting guides or recipes from various sources, such as quests, events, bosses, or other players. You can also buy them from the Item Mall for real money.
 
Once you have a weapon crafting guide or recipe, you need to gather the materials required for it. These may include metals, gems, wood, leather, cloth, or other items. You can find these materials by mining, gathering, hunting, or buying them from other players or NPCs.
 
When you have all the materials, go to the NPC blacksmith and open the crafting menu. Select the weapon crafting guide or recipe and drag it to the slot on the left. Then drag the materials to the slots on the right. Click on "Craft" and wait for the process to finish. You will now have a new weapon that you can use or upgrade.
