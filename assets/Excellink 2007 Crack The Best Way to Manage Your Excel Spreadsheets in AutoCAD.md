If you are using AutoCAD 2007 for your design projects, you may want to link your block attributes to an Excel sheet. This can help you to manage your data more efficiently, update your drawings automatically, and create reports such as room schedules, BOMs, lists, and computed attributes.
 
One way to do this is to use Excellink 2007, an ARX application that allows you to bidirectionally hot link attribute and geometrical block data (insertion point, scale, rotation) between an AutoCAD drawing and an Excel 2000/XP/2003 sheet[^1^]. Excellink 2007 is a product of CAD Studio, a leading provider of custom CAD/GIS/PDM applications and services.

In this article, we will show you how to use Excellink 2007 to link your AutoCAD 2007 block attributes to an Excel sheet. We will assume that you have already installed Excellink 2007 on your computer and that you have a drawing with some blocks and attributes that you want to link.
 
## Step 1: Create an Excel Sheet with the Attribute Data
 
The first step is to create an Excel sheet with the data that you want to link to your AutoCAD block attributes. You can use any Excel format (XLS, XLSX, CSV) and any number of columns and rows. The only requirement is that the first row of your Excel sheet must contain the names of the attributes that you want to link. For example, if you have a block with attributes "TAG", "AREA", and "PRICE", your Excel sheet should look something like this:

| TAG | AREA | PRICE |
| --- | --- | --- |

| A-01 | 50 | 1000 |

| A-02 | 60 | 1200 |

| A-03 | 70 | 1400 |

| B-01 | 80 | 1600 |

| B-02 | 90 | 1800 |

| B-03 | 100 | 2000 |

You can also include formulas, functions, and references in your Excel sheet, as long as they are compatible with Excel 2000/XP/2003. For example, you can use the SUM function to calculate the total price of all the blocks in your drawing:

| TAG | AREA | PRICE |
| --- | --- | --- |

| A-01 | 50 | 1000 |

| A-02 | 60 | 1200 |

| A-03 | 70 | 1400 |

| B-01 | 80 | 1600 |

| B-02 | 90 | 1800 |

| B-03 | 100 |<Step 2: Load Excellink 2007 in AutoCAD 2007
The next step is to load Excellink 2007 in AutoCAD 2007. To do this, you need to run the command EXLLOAD from the AutoCAD command line. This will load the Excellink ARX module and display a dialog box with the Excellink options. You can also access the Excellink options from the Tools menu or the Excellink toolbar.

The Excellink options dialog box allows you to set various parameters for the link between AutoCAD and Excel, such as the Excel file name, the Excel sheet name, the block name, the attribute names, the link direction, and the update mode. You can also save and load your settings as an INI file for future use.
Step 3: Link AutoCAD Block Attributes to Excel Sheet with Excellink 2007
The final step is to link your AutoCAD block attributes to your Excel sheet with Excellink 2007. To do this, you need to run the command EXLATTACH from the AutoCAD command line. This will display a dialog box where you can select the blocks that you want to link and specify the link direction (from Excel to AutoCAD or from AutoCAD to Excel).
