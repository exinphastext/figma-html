Fonetika is a book by Kassai Ilona, a Hungarian linguist and phonetician, that introduces the basics of phonetics, the scientific study of speech sounds. The book covers topics such as the articulation, acoustics, perception and neurology of speech, as well as the relation between speech and writing, and the transcription systems for different languages. The book also includes exercises and examples for students to practice their phonetic skills.

The book is available as a PDF file on Scribd[^1^], a platform for online reading and publishing. It is also used as a course material for Fonetika (BBN-MNY-211), a phonetics course at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University in Budapest[^2^]. The book is written in Hungarian, but it uses the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and other symbols to represent speech sounds from various languages.
 
Fonetika is a useful resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the sounds of human language and how they are produced, transmitted and perceived. It is also a valuable reference for linguists, language teachers, speech therapists, singers and other professionals who work with speech.
  
Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds, or in the case of sign languages, the equivalent aspects of sign[^3^]. Linguists who specialize in studying the physical properties of speech are phoneticians. Phonetics can be divided into three main subfields: articulatory phonetics, acoustic phonetics and auditory phonetics.
 
Articulatory phonetics deals with the configurations of the vocal organs that produce speech sounds. The vocal organs include the lungs, the larynx, the pharynx, the oral cavity and the nasal cavity. The movements of these organs create different types of sounds, such as vowels, consonants and tones. Articulatory phoneticians use symbols and diagrams to describe how speech sounds are made and classify them according to their place and manner of articulation.
 
Acoustic phonetics deals with the physical properties of speech sounds as they travel through the air. These properties include frequency, amplitude, duration and spectrum. Acoustic phoneticians use instruments and software to measure and analyze these properties and represent them graphically using waveforms and spectrograms. Acoustic phonetics can help us understand how speech sounds vary in different contexts and how they are affected by noise and distortion.
 
Auditory phonetics deals with how speech sounds are perceived by the human ear and brain. Auditory phoneticians study how listeners identify and interpret speech sounds and how they use cues such as pitch, loudness, rhythm and intonation to convey meaning. Auditory phonetics can also help us understand how speech perception is influenced by factors such as age, gender, dialect, accent and hearing impairment.
