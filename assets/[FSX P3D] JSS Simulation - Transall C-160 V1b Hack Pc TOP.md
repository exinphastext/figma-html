The Transall C-160 was designed by a consortium of German, French and Dutch companies to meet the cargo and troop transport needs of their air forces. It was also sold to South Africa and Turkey, and performed various roles such as aerial refuelling, electronic intelligence, communications and cargo discharge. The C-160 has a large cargo hold with a rear ramp access, a high-mounted wing and a short takeoff and landing capability. It can carry up to 16 tons of payload or 90 troops for up to 5,000 km.
 
JSS Simulations has recreated the Transall C-160 with great attention to detail and accuracy. The exterior and interior models are very detailed and feature high-resolution textures of four air force liveries (German, French, South African and Turkish). The cockpit is fully functional and realistic, with instrument reflections, working systems (including pressurization) and 3D pilots. The aircraft also has many animations, such as cargo door, jump doors, crew windows, inspection hatches, nose cone and yoke.
 
One of the unique features of this add-on is the simulated discharge procedure, which allows you to drop cargo or paratroopers from the rear ramp. You can also use the integrated API for the Milviz/REX WX Advantage Weather Radar, which is a sophisticated weather detection and avoidance system that works with any weather engine. The add-on also comes with a comprehensive manual that explains the history, features and operation of the C-160.
 
The JSS Simulations Transall C-160 is a quality aircraft that combines realism and fun. It is suitable for both beginners and advanced simmers who want to experience the challenges and rewards of flying a military transport aircraft. You can buy it now from Flight1.com[^4^] or simMarket[^1^] for EUR 24.95.
  
The Transall C-160 is not only a cargo and troop transport aircraft, but also a versatile platform that can perform various missions. Some of the variants of the C-160 include the C-160 NG (New Generation), which has improved avionics, engines and propellers, and can perform aerial refuelling as a tanker or a receiver; the C-160G Gabriel, which is an electronic intelligence gathering aircraft with various antennas and sensors; the C-160H Astarte, which is a communications relay aircraft for submarine operations; and the C-160P, which is a civilian version used by Air France for mail transport.
