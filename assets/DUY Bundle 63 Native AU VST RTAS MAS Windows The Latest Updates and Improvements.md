Here are some of the features and benefits of each plug-in in the DUY Bundle 63 Native AU VST RTAS MAS Windows:

- **DUY DaD Tape**: This plug-in simulates the sound of analog tapes for digital audio systems. It features physical modeling of the four most representative tape recorders on the market: Studer A80, Ampex ATR-102, Revox PR99, and Tascam 32. You can adjust the tape speed, bias, wow and flutter, saturation, compression, and more. You can also choose between different tape types and noise reduction systems. DUY DaD Tape adds warmth, depth, and character to your audio.
- **DUY DaD Valve**: This plug-in is a physical-modeling-based classic tube simulator for digital audio systems. It features the most popular types of valves: triode, tetrode, and pentode. You can adjust the biasing and operating levels of the valves, as well as the input and output impedance, feedback, and distortion. You can also choose between different circuit configurations and tube models. DUY DaD Valve adds richness, harmonics, and dynamics to your audio.
- **DUY Wide**: This plug-in is a stereo and multichannel spatial enhancer. It allows widening of the stereo image, as well as sound placement outside the physical speaker locations. You can adjust the width, depth, position, and angle of each channel independently. You can also apply different processing modes: linear phase, minimum phase, or hybrid. DUY Wide is mono-compatible and preserves the phase coherence of the audio.
- **DUY MagicEQ LE**: This plug-in is a mastering tool based on a new equalization concept that makes it an automatic equalizer. It adapts to the spectral content of the audio and applies a smooth and transparent equalization curve. You can adjust the amount of equalization, as well as the frequency range and resolution. You can also choose between different modes: flat, loudness, or custom. DUY MagicEQ LE enhances the clarity, balance, and loudness of your audio.
- **DUY Magic Spectrum**: This plug-in is a high-quality mastering tool that allows you to perform spectrum matching or modify the frequency content of your audio. It displays the spectrum of your audio in real time and lets you edit it with simple and powerful tools. You can draw, erase, smooth, or copy any part of the spectrum. You can also import or export spectral data from other sources. DUY Magic Spectrum allows you to shape the sound of your audio precisely.
- **DUY Silence**: This plug-in is an amazing noise-reduction plug-in that removes unwanted noise from your audio. It analyzes the noise profile of your audio and applies a sophisticated algorithm to eliminate it. You can adjust the threshold, reduction, attack, and release parameters. You can also use simple and powerful edition tools to fine-tune the noise reduction process. DUY Silence restores the quality and clarity of your audio.
