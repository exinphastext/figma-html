Hellgate London is a role-playing game that was released in 2007 by Flagship Studios. The game is set in a futuristic London that has been invaded by demons and other creatures from hell. The player can choose from six different classes: Templar, Cabalist, Hunter, Engineer, Evoker and Summoner. Each class has its own skills, weapons and equipment that can be customized and upgraded.
 
The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the player can explore the randomly generated levels and complete various quests and missions. In multiplayer mode, the player can join other players online and cooperate or compete with them. The game also has a PvP mode where players can fight against each other in different arenas.
 
Hellgate London received mixed reviews from critics and players. Some praised the game's graphics, gameplay and variety, while others criticized the game's bugs, glitches and lack of polish. The game also suffered from financial and technical issues that led to the closure of Flagship Studios in 2008. The game's servers were shut down in 2009, making the multiplayer mode inaccessible.
 
However, the game still has a loyal fan base that continues to play and mod the game. In 2018, a remastered version of the game was released by HanbitSoft, a Korean company that acquired the rights to the game. The remastered version features improved graphics, performance and stability, as well as new content and features. The remastered version is available on Steam for Windows PC.
